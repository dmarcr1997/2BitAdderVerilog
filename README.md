# 2BitAdderVerilog

A simple 2-bit adder written in Verilog HDL. This module performs binary addition on two 2-bit input values and outputs a 3-bit result.

## ðŸ”§ Files

- `twoBitAdderV1.v` â€” Top-level module that connects a half adder and full adder
- `halfAdderV1.v` â€” Basic half adder implementation
- `fullAdderV1.v` â€” Basic full adder implementation

## âœ… Features

- Combines half adder and full adder to perform 2-bit binary addition
- Modular design, easy to test or integrate into larger FPGA projects

## ðŸ§ª Usage
I simulated this with APIO but feel free to use any Verilog testbench to run this code. I am thinking of using this to test some FPGA logic on a Tang Nano 20k in the near future.
